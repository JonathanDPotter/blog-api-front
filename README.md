# Blog

Front end for the Odin Project Blog project. The app has full CRUD functionality with local authorization and redux state management.The back-end repo can be found [here](https://github.com/JonathanDPotter/rest-api), and the back end is hosted [here](https://jonathan-potter-rest-api.herokuapp.com/).

## Technologies Used

The app is written with typescript in react. I utilize react-router, reduxjs-toolkit, axios, fontawesome icons and tailwindcss.

## Functionality

A user that has not logged in will see all published blog posts on the home page, but must register and log in to make posts. Upon logging in, a user can make posts and view all of their own posts whether they have been "published" or not. Unpublished posts are only viewable by the author, and the author can edit or delete their own posts.
